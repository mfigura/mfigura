My research projects entail new designs of multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and distributed control algorithms.
I analyze properties of the algorithms by applying knowledge of stochastic approximation and control theory and perform
an empirical evaluation through simulations using programming tools such as Python, Tensorflow, Matlab, and Simulink.
