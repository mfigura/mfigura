I design multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and distributed control algorithms.
I analyze properties of the algorithms by applying knowledge of stochastic approximation
and control theory, and perform empirical evaluation through simulations using programming
tools such as Python, Tensorflow, Matlab, and Simulink.
